# Introduction to mamulengo

Mamulengo is a lightweight database based on Datascript and
some plug-gable durable storage that targets both Clojure
and ClojureScript.

The project has no intention to be incredibly performative,
but we want to be useful as an alternative to SQLite-sized
projects.

Any ideas for improvement is very welcome! Be nice =)

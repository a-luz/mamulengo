A lightweight database based on `datascript` and a pluggable
storage for data durability. In fact, `mamulengo` has
probably poor performance when compared to other solutions
and its purpose is small-sized applications that need an
embedded database to get its business moving.


We use `datascript` as the main database, but write every
transaction to a durable storage. Therefore, because of this
simple addition we are able to provide two features to
improve datascript and enable it to be a full-fledged
immutable database: i)durability and ii) time-travel feature
as in Datomic.

Mamulengo supports PostgreSQL and H2 database already!


*Bleedinng-edge project.. Still wondering about APIs and code organization..*


## Usage

```clj
(require '[mamulengo.core :as m])

(def cfg {:durable-storage :postgresql
          :durable-conf {:dbtype "postgresql"
                         :dbname "mamulengo"
                         :password "test"
                         :user "test"}})

(m/connect! cfg)


;;; let's define a schema
(def schema-planets
  {:body/name {:db/cardinality :db.cardinality/one
               :db/unique :db.unique/identity}
   :body/diameter {:db/cardinality :db.cardinality/one
                   :db/unique :db.unique/identity}})

(m/transact-schema! schema-planets)

;;; now you are ready to save your data!!
(m/transact! [{:db/id -1
                     :body/name "Earth"
                     :body/diameter 12740}
                    {:db/id -2
                     :body/name "Pluto"
                     :body/diameter 80}
                    {:db/id -3
                     :body/name "Venus"
                     :body/diameter 12100}])

;;; you should also retrieve it back!
(m/query! '[:find (pull ?e [*])
            :in $ ?n
            :where
            [?e :body/name ?n]]
            ["Pluto"])

```


## Ideas

The idea came from **Rodolfo Ferreira** about rethinking some
concepts on databases and reaching the conclusion that not all applications need an
insane amount of write/reads per second. Sometimes we only
need a SQLite to do our work and go home happily.

However, we still want the advantages of Datascript and
Immutable data sources.

The very initial code was inspired in  https://gitlab.com/kurtosys/lib/factoidic.

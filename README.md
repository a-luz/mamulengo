A lightweight database based on `datascript` and a pluggable
storage for data durability.



Bleedinng-edge PR.. Still wondering about APIs and code organization..

## Usage

FIXME


## Ideas

The idea came from **Rodolfo Ferreira** about rethinking some
concepts on databases and reaching the conclusion that not all applications need an
insane amount of write/reads per second. Sometimes we only
need a SQLite to do our work and go home happily.

However, we still want the advantages of Datascript and
Immutable data sources.

The very initial code was inspired in  https://gitlab.com/kurtosys/lib/factoidic.

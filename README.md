# mamulengo [![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/mamulengo.svg)](https://clojars.org/mamulengo) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wandersoncferreira/mamulengo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wandersoncferreira/mamulengo)

<img src="https://github.com/wandersoncferreira/mamulengo/blob/master/doc/mamulengo_fuzue.jpg" width=260 align="right"/>

A lightweight database based on
[datascript](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript) and a
pluggable storage for data durability. In fact, `mamulengo`
has probably poor performance when compared to other
solutions and its purpose is small-sized applications that
need an embedded database to get its business moving.

If you are also interesting to learn more about its
internals, it has a very simple architecture and can be
really useful to study purpose.

We use [datascript](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript) as
the main database, but write every transaction to a durable
storage. Therefore, because of this simple addition we are
able to provide i) durability and ii) time-travel feature as
in Datomic.

Datomic doesn't fit for small projects so well, therefore
many projects who could benefit from it, can't. This library
aims to provide a feel for Datalog/Datomic to newcomers.

Mamulengo supports [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
and [H2](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) for
Clojure and [Local Storage](https://funcool.github.io/hodgepodge/) for ClojureScript as durable storages.

## Release and Dependency Information

This project follows the version scheme MAJOR.MINOR.COMMITS
where MAJOR and MINOR provide some relative indication of
the size of the change, but do not follow semantic
versioning. In general, all changes endeavor to be
non-breaking (by moving to new names rather than by breaking
existing names). COMMITS is an ever-increasing counter of
commits since the beginning of this repository.


## Installation

Leinigen/Boot

```clj
[mamulengo "1.0.72"]
```

Clojure CLI/deps.edn
```clj
mamulengo {:mvn/version "1.0.72"}
```


## Usage

```clj
(require '[mamulengo.core :as m])

(def cfg {:durable-storage :postgresql
          :durable-conf {:dbtype "postgresql"
                         :dbname "mamulengo"
                         :password "test"
                         :user "test"}})

;;; let's define a schema
(def schema-planets
  {:body/name {:db/cardinality :db.cardinality/one
               :db/unique :db.unique/identity}
   :body/diameter {:db/cardinality :db.cardinality/one
                   :db/unique :db.unique/identity}})

(m/connect! cfg schema-planets)


;;; now you are ready to save your data!!
(m/transact! [{:db/id -1
                     :body/name "Earth"
                     :body/diameter 12740}
                    {:db/id -2
                     :body/name "Pluto"
                     :body/diameter 80}
                    {:db/id -3
                     :body/name "Venus"
                     :body/diameter 12100}])

;;; you should also retrieve it back!
(m/query! '[:find (pull ?e [*])
            :in $ ?n
            :where
            [?e :body/name ?n]]
            "Pluto")

```

## Time Travel

All the current durable storages has support for
time-travel. The API behaves similarly with Datomic one, you
can pass an old Database/Connection object to the query
function. 

```clj

(def db-as-of (m/as-of! #inst "2020-02-18T11:46:31.505-00:00"))

;;; more things happening...

(m/query! '[:find ?name
            :where [?e :body/name ?name]]
            db-as-of)

;;; more things...
(def db-since (m/since! #inst "2020-02-18T11:46:31.505-00:00"))


;;; you can also use the history database to query data across all time.
(def db-history (m/history!))


```

You can only capture a database using a timestamp, an option to use the transaction id might be on the way.
Please, see either `time-travel-{pg,h2}-test` namespaces to
see some working examples.


## Why the project `mamulengo`?

I just discover the project called
[datahike](https://github.com/replikativ/datahike) which is
a lot more sophisticated and complete than mamulengo.

Apart from the hitchhiker-tree algorithm used in the
project, both of them has very similar goals and ways to
extend for different durable storages.

`mamulengo` has the apparent advantage of easier
architecture to understand how the whole system works if you
are interested in its internals. However, `mamulengo` has no
intention to become more robust to handle large
applications, it will remain as an alternative to newcomers
to use in their small personal projects and to learn
datalog.

Feel free to try both!!


## Why the name `mamulengo`?

In Brazilian culture we have a very famous event in the
northeast region called
[mamulengo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamulengo) which
is a puppet theater. In front of the public we have the
puppets that entertain and captivate the audience and behind
it we have the hands of the artist that brings movements and
voice to the puppets.

`Mamulengo` here has the same objectives, we want you to be
amazed by `datalog` query engines and all the bells and
whistle of immutable databases, but behind the scenes we manage the hard work to make this possible with no overhead
introduced to the audience.


## Ideas

The idea came from **Rodolfo Ferreira** about rethinking
some concepts on databases and reaching the conclusion that
not all applications need an insane amount of write/reads
per second. Sometimes we only need a SQLite to do our work
and go home happily.

However, we still want the advantages of Datascript and
Immutable data sources.

The very initial code was inspired in  https://gitlab.com/kurtosys/lib/factoidic.

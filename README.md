# mamulengo

A lightweight database based on `datascript` and a pluggable
storage for data durability. In fact, `mamulengo` has
probably poor performance when compared to other solutions
and its purpose is small-sized applications that need an
embedded database to get its business moving.


We use `datascript` as the main database, but write every
transaction to a durable storage. Therefore, because of this
simple addition we are able to provide two features to
improve datascript and enable it to be a full-fledged
immutable database: i)durability and ii) time-travel feature
as in Datomic.


Bleedinng-edge PR.. Still wondering about APIs and code organization..

## Usage

FIXME


## Ideas

The idea came from **Rodolfo Ferreira** about rethinking some
ideas about database and that not all applications need an
insane amount of write/reads per second. Sometimes we only
need a SQLite to do our work and go home happily.

However, we still want the advantages of Datascript and
Immutable data sources.

The very initial code was inspired in  https://gitlab.com/kurtosys/lib/factoidic.
